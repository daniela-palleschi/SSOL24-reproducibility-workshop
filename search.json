If you are currently in the middle of analysing some data, you may not want to update R right now. In this case, just make note of which version you’re currently running (e.g., by running R.version in the Console)\nhaving an R version from 2023 or later should suffice\n\ninstall or update RStudio\n\nI am currently using RStudio version 2023.12.1+402, as I encountered issues when updating to 2024.04.2+764 in April when it was released. As a rule of thumb, I update R and/or RStudio a few months after their initial release",
